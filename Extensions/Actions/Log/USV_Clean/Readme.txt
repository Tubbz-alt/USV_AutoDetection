USV_Clean was designed as part of the USV template detection programming. During detection, many different templates may be combined
to detect a single vocalization. This program allows these individual components of a USV to be combined in order to produce one final
'Detection' box surrounding the USV.



To Do: 
-Detect Peak-Hz within this program.
-Insert protection against redundancies.
