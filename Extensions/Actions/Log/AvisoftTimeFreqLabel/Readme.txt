This extension can be used to export a text file of timestamps that can then be imported into Avisoft SASLabPro.
The exported text file will contain a column of timestamps and corresponding frequencies. These are the peak-time
and peak-frequency as determined by the Detection procedure. These time and frequency pairs can then be imported into
Avisoft to place a marker at the peak time/frequency location for each detection.
