Streamsplit will allow many files to be loaded as a 'file stream'.  These file streams can be processed as a 'Batch' and then split into individual logs for each individual file by the stream-split command.

Please not that these logs are for use in XBAT and still return timestamps for each USV/Vocalization/Detection that are relative to
the start of the stream.
