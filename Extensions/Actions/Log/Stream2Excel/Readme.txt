This tool is new and is still undergoing beta testing.

This program splits detections from a file stream into a Excel file logs containing detections for each individual
file in the stream.  In doing this, USV times are provided relative to the start of each individual file in
the stream and not relative to the start of the stream.

This tool is useful for 'batch processing' many files in a stream and then exporting individual logs for later use.
